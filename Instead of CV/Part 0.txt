Introduction. What for this all?

In this year I'd (once again) noticed that all my "curriculum vitaes" (CV's) are appreciably outdated.

It's, in fact, ok. Because I'm the good engineer, and most times "job finds me".

But, what to do with old CV's? It's also looks like the task that must be solved.

The problem I view in CV's for technical vacations: most of them are about skills, therefore been the a set of scalars. HR know almost nothing about such a skills, but can parse them like some signatures.

This way of recruiting is highly ineffective, and leads to a lot of unnecessary interviews. Because scalar skills are not about "how he/she thinks/solves tasks". Just "this person know something about this word".

Ok, I understand the problem. What to do with it?

Now, I'm attempting to build a set of articles/essays. About "what I did/do". How I do. For what I do.

I believe, they can be interesting/useful for my colleges in engineering.

And me too. Like learning Chinese/Turkish (in my practice), doing uncommon things improves "mind deviations". Thus, taking more resources for solving regular tasks.

Also, I believe that doing so takes a chance to improve interaction. While elaborating sophisticated back-ends is highly interesting, it leaves too few resources to make already done (and working) solutions popular.

Let's go!
